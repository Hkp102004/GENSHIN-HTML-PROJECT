            <p>Venti is the anemo archon who controls the wind 
                and knows as the ruler of mondstadth although he's a
                really kind and gentle archon who never ruled the people 
                but instead let them be comepletly free and enjoy the 
                freedom. The people of mondstadth still never forget to 
                thank him for his kindness and the freedom he gave them
                and pray to him as <b>lord barbatos</b>. Venti is said to be 
                really powerfull during old times, he can make black holes, 
                split mountails. He can control the wind but nowadays he just 
                disguises himself as a plain bard to live among normal people.
